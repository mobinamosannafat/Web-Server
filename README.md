# Web Server

In this repo you can find implementation of a web server that has the ability to respond to multiple requests simultaneously and can return the requested pages with their content to the client.
This web server also has the ability to log requests, that is, if a client requests, his IP, the URL of the requested page, as well as the time and date of the request, are saved in logfile.txt.
Also in this repository, a fake website has been implemented to test the web server.
